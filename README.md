# Next.js code example

## Overvie
- This is a 1 "feature" from recent project which responsible for "Project" entity.
- You can see that every page implements Container/Presenter design pattern which realy good fon next.js. (IMHO)
- Also you can find "WithRole" component from auth feature which takes roles who authorized to see, manage this component.
